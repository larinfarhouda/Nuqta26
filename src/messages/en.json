            "subtitle": "Everything you need to know about managing events on Nuqta",
            "q1": "How is Nuqta different from WhatsApp groups?",
            "a1": "WhatsApp groups require you to manage every booking manually, chase payment screenshots, and spend hours following up. Nuqta automates all of this: professional booking system, bilingual email confirmations, automatic attendance lists, and an integrated dashboard. Saves an average of 10-15 hours per event. Plus, we put you in front of 5,000+ active users looking for events—something a private group can't do.",
            "q2": "What if I only organize events occasionally?",
            "a2": "Perfect! Our Starter plan is completely free for one active event. You can use it for your first event, pause it, and come back when you're ready for the next one. No monthly fees if you only organize one event at a time. When you need more, upgrading is easy and you can downgrade again anytime.",
            "q3": "Do I need to know Turkish to use Nuqta?",
            "a3": "Not at all! The entire platform is in Arabic. All attendee emails are automatically sent in both Arabic and English—no manual translation needed. Even if you don't speak Turkish, you can manage professional events for the Arab community in Turkey with ease.",
            "q4": "How do attendees find my events?",
            "a4": "Your event is automatically displayed on Nuqta's discovery page, visited by 5,000+ active Arab users monthly in Turkey. Plus, you get a custom public page you can share on Instagram, Facebook, and your own channels. Our system includes optimized SEO, so your events appear when people search for Arab activities in Istanbul. Nuqta works as both a marketing platform and management tool.",
            "q5": "What happens to my data if I cancel my subscription?",
            "a5": "Your data is always yours. You can export all attendee information, sales, and reviews anytime from your dashboard. If you cancel, we keep your data for 90 days (in case you want to come back), then securely delete it upon request. There's no data lock-in—you always have full control and the ability to leave at any moment without losing your information.",
            "q6": "Do I need technical knowledge to use Nuqta?",
            "a6": "Not at all! Nuqta is designed to be user-friendly. You can create and manage events in minutes without any technical skills. Our platform handles all the complexity for you.",
            "q7": "How does the bilingual system work?",
            "a7": "All emails and notifications are automatically sent in both Arabic and English to your attendees. You only need to enter your event details once, and we handle the bilingual communication.",
            "q8": "What payment methods can I accept?",
            "a8": "You can accept payments via bank transfer in Turkey. Attendees submit payment proof through the platform, and you can verify and manage all bookings from your dashboard.",
            "q9": "How does the verified review system work?",
            "a9": "Only attendees who actually attended your event can leave reviews. This prevents fake reviews and ensures your brand reputation is protected with authentic feedback from real participants.",
            "q10": "Can I try Nuqta before committing to a paid plan?",
            "a10": "Yes! Our Starter plan is completely free and includes 1 active event with all features. You can test the platform's full capabilities before upgrading to a paid plan.",
            "q11": "Can I upgrade or downgrade anytime?",
            "a11": "Yes, absolutely! You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel anytime from your dashboard with one click. No long-term contracts or cancellation fees. If you upgrade, you get additional features immediately. If you downgrade, the change takes effect at the beginning of your next billing cycle.",
